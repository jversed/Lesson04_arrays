Arrays in Java
---------------------------------
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. Following are some important point about Java arrays.

In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.
Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using member length.

► A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.

► The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0.

► Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable or a method parameter.

► The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not long or short.

► The direct superclass of an array type is Object.

► Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.


Array can contains primitives data types as well as objects of a class depending on the definition of array. In case of primitives data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.
